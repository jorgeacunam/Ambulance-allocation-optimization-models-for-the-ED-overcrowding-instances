# Ambulance-allocation-optimization-models-for-the-ED-overcrowding-instances
Set of data instances to run the numerical experiments.

## Instances
We defined six classes of scenarios and generated five instances per class. The data utilized was created through random processes in a range of plausible values based on the real scenario studied in section 5 of the article. The difference among the classes is characterized by the number of emergencies and the number of emergency departments.

## Data
The following is the list of files per instance in csv format:

1) Emergency departments (EDs) characteristics.
2) Patients characteristics.
3) Travel time from emergency to hospitals.
4) Parameters of EDs waiting time.
5) Number of walk-in patients per ED per period of time 
6) Number of patients waiting in EDs at the beginning of time 0. 
7) The proportion of patients that did not receive service in a given period per each ED. 

## Classes
We next provide the characteristics of each class in the numerical experiment. 

1) 50 ambulance emergencies and 10 EDs.
2) 80 ambulance emergencies and 15 EDs.
3) 100 ambulance emergencies and 15 EDs.
4) 100 ambulance emergencies and 20 EDs.
5) 150 ambulance emergencies and 20 EDs.
6) 200 ambulance emergencies and 30 EDs.
